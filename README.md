## Summary
Natural Language processing can help crypto investors analyze social mdeia sentiment in order to form well-rounded investment decisions. In this case, I pulled 18 days worth of articles on Ethereum and Bitcoin. I found that articles from this recent time period are generally leaning to a positive sentiment score. This means that ETH and BTC are being percieved positively by various news outlets, which could insinuate that it is a good time to invest. Additionally, BTC has a higher avg positive sentiment score than ETH. However, both currencies are very close in average compound sentiment score.
